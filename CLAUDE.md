**IMPORTANT**: For all project information including development commands, scripts, coding guidelines, project structure, and setup instructions, read [README.md](./README.md) first.

# Tools

- Prefer `rg` over `find`. Use `tldr rg` or `rg --help` to learn about the tool.

# Workflow

- Always read [README.md](./README.md) for project context, development commands, and coding guidelines
- When testing the live application, use Puppeteer MCP tools to interact with `http://localhost:3001`
- Follow the quirky fun theme (household objects, fruits) specified in README.md
- Use the path aliases and project structure documented in README.md
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Commit your code every time you finish a major change
