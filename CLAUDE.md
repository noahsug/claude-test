**IMPORTANT**: For all project information including development commands, scripts, coding guidelines, project structure, and setup instructions, read [README.md](./README.md) first.

# Workflow

- Always read [README.md](./README.md) for project context, development commands, and coding guidelines
- When testing the live application, use Puppeteer MCP tools to interact with `http://localhost:3001`
- Follow the quirky fun theme (household objects, fruits) specified in README.md
- Use the path aliases and project structure documented in README.md
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Make a git commit whenever you finish a chunk of work
