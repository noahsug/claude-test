# Issues

## Visual Issues

### Main App

[ ] The background doesn't go all the way to the edges (there's a white border at the edge of the screen)

### Card Grid

[ ] There should be a margin between cards. They borders of cards shouldn't be touching.

### Card

[ ] Card names and card descriptions don't fit on the card (they're cut off with '...'). Ensure card
names and descriptions always fit in the card without being cut off with '...'. Perhaps we can
do this by making the card title and card description font size responsive based on how long the
text is.

[ ] Remove the drop shadow on text as it makes the text hard to read

[ ] remove the chunky borders around cost, attack, defense and rarity.

[ ] add some padding around the rarity and cost text so the box shadow is larger than the text.

[ ] Attack, defense and rarity should not zoom in when hovered over.

[ ] The card image should zoom in when any part of the card is hovered over. Currently it only
zooms in on the image when the image itself is hovered over.

[ ] The card title and rarity text should have some margin between it and the left card border.

[ ] remove the box shadow around attack and defense

[ ] Use a more fun font for the card descriptions (but ensure it's still readable).

## Changes

[ ] Remove "household heroes collection" section

[ ] Rename "Pixel Cards" to "Household Heroes"

[ ] When a card is clicked, we now want to display the selected card in the center of the screen
and dim everything behind it (the background, the other cards, the app title, etc). Clicking the
card a 2nd time closes the modal (there is no "x" button to close it).
