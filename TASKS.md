# Project Tasks

## Phase 1: Project Setup

### Initial Setup

- [x] Initialize Vite project with Preact and TypeScript
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS
- [x] Set up Prettier configuration
- [x] Set up React Testing Library
- [x] Configure Storybook
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Set up development scripts (dev, build, preview, test, storybook)

### Development Environment

- [x] Configure TypeScript settings
- [x] Set up ESLint
- [x] Create initial file structure following flat organization principles
- [x] Verify development server runs correctly

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure

### Data Structure

- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for card data (Card interface completed)
- [x] Create sample card data (4 sample cards with placeholder images)
- [x] Plan card properties (name, image, description, stats, rarity)

### Base Components

- [x] Update main App component to display card grid instead of counter demo
- [x] Set up basic hash-based routing for card details (e.g., `#card-1`)
  - Use simple `window.location.hash` approach to avoid adding router dependency
  - Cards should be clickable and update URL hash
  - Support back button navigation
- [x] Create layout components:
  - [x] Header component with app title and gradient background
  - [x] CardGrid component to display all cards in responsive grid
  - [x] CardDetail component to show expanded card view when hash is present
- [x] Implement basic navigation between card grid and card detail views

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Routing**: Use hash-based routing (`#card-1`) for simplicity, no external router needed
- **Layout**: Keep gradient background theme, header with title, main content area for cards
- **Card Detail**: Show as overlay/modal when URL hash matches card ID
- **Images**: Using placeholder images for now, will replace with actual card art later
- **Card Layout**: Use flexbox with wrapping - cards should display multiple per row and wrap automatically as screen is resized (IMPORTANT: maintain this flexible wrapping behavior)

## Phase 3: Card System Refactoring

### Card Component Extraction

- [x] Extract individual Card component from CardGrid inline implementation
- [x] Move card image display, text layout, and styling to Card component
- [x] Preserve existing hover effects and animations in Card component
- [x] Ensure Card component is responsive and reusable
- [x] Create Card component Storybook stories
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for Card component

### CardGrid Refactoring

- [x] CardGrid component exists but needs refactoring
- [x] Refactor CardGrid to use the new Card component
- [x] Clean up CardGrid to focus only on grid layout and spacing
- [x] Verify responsive grid layout works on all breakpoints (sm/md/lg/xl)
- [x] IMPORTANT: Use flexible wrapping layout - multiple cards per row that wrap on resize
- [x] Optimize CardGrid performance for large card sets (React.memo implemented)
- [x] Create updated CardGrid component Storybook stories
- [x] Update existing CardGrid unit tests

### Component Architecture Decisions

**Current State:**

- CardGrid: Handles both grid layout AND individual card rendering (needs separation)
- CardArtwork: Handles visual artwork generation ✓
- CardDetail: Handles modal display ✓

**Target Architecture:**

- **Card**: Individual card component (name, cost, stats, artwork, hover effects)
- **CardGrid**: Grid container component (layout, spacing, responsiveness)
- **CardArtwork**: Visual artwork component (unchanged) ✓
- **CardDetail**: Modal detail view (unchanged) ✓

**Benefits:**

- Better component reusability (Card can be used elsewhere)
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier testing and Storybook development
- Better performance with React.memo potential

## Phase 4: Styling and Theme

### Visual Design

- [ ] Implement quirky fun visual theme with household objects and fruits
- [ ] Create card border and background styles
- [ ] Add typography styling
- [ ] Implement bright, cheerful color scheme
- [ ] Add card rarity visual indicators

### Responsive Design

- [ ] Refine mobile layout with responsive CSS
- [ ] Optimize tablet layout with appropriate breakpoints
- [ ] Polish desktop layout for larger screens
- [ ] Add smooth transitions and animations

## Phase 5: Interactions

### Card Interactions

- [ ] Implement card hover effects
- [ ] Add click interactions
- [ ] Create card detail view
- [ ] Add loading states for card images

### User Experience

- [ ] Optimize performance and loading times
- [ ] Implement smooth scrolling
- [ ] Verify user interactions work in browser dev tools device mode

## Phase 6: Polish and Optimization

### Performance

- [ ] Optimize images and assets
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for cards
- [ ] Minimize bundle size
- [ ] Verify loading performance with browser dev tools

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- [ ] Test responsive design in browser dev tools
- [ ] Run automated accessibility checks with browser tools
- [ ] Code review and cleanup
- [ ] Update documentation

### Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Configure build process
- [ ] Build and verify production bundle
- [ ] Create deployment configuration files
- [ ] Verify all features work in production build

## Optional Enhancements

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Card filtering/search functionality
- [ ] Card sorting options
- [ ] Animation improvements
- [ ] Sound effects (if appropriate)
- [ ] Card collection/favorites system

### Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Complete test coverage for all components
- [ ] Write integration tests for user interactions
- [ ] Run automated accessibility tests
- [ ] Document all components in Storybook
- [ ] Create visual regression tests
- [ ] Test error states and edge cases

### Technical Improvements

- [ ] Implement error boundaries
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize SEO (if applicable)
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
